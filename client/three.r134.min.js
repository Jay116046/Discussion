// Minified THREE.js v134 - In production, fetch from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.134/build/three.min.js and place here.
// For this stub, include the full minified code or use CDN, but since local is required, assume it's copied here.
// Note: Actual minified code is very long; in practice, download and place the file.
